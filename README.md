# Loan-Eligibility-Project

This machine learning Project can be used to automate the loan eligibility checking process.This machine learning model can save time and resources of major financial organizations.
The machine learning model is trained using historic loan eligibility dataset. I trained multiple classification models and selected logistic regression model as it produced the highest model accuracy compared to random forest classifier and decision tree classifier. The accuracy of the model is increased using hyperparameter tuning.
